1. Copy this file (into _posts)
2. Re-name the new file so that it has the current date at the start of its file name (in *yyy-mm-dd* format)
3. Open the new file up and change its attributes -- change *title*, *date*, and *published* to match your post 
  - (DON'T change the *layout* attribute
  - The *published* attribute can only have the values *true* or *false*
  - You can add more categories to the categories section (not recommended), but make sure to keep the *blog* category first!
4. Rebuild Jekyll and publish to your site

If you prefer writing blog posts in HTML instead of [markdown] (https://www.google.com/?search#q=markdown tutorial), change the extension of your post from *.markdown* to *.html*.

Remember: for a post to be displayed on your blog, the *published* attribute has to be set to *true*.


Happy blogging!
