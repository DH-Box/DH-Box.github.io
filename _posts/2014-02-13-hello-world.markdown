Want to create blog posts? Simple!

<ol>

<li>
Copy this file (into _posts)
</li>

<li>
Re-name the new file so that it has the current date at the start of its file name (in yyy-mm-dd format)
</li>

<li>
Open the new file up and change the heading -- change <em>title</em>, <em>date</em>, and <em>categories</em> to match your post (DON'T change the <em>layout</em>)
</li>

<li>
Rebuild Jekyll and publish to your site
</li>

</ol>

Wherever you'd like a link to your blog, you can now use {{ page.url }}

Happy blogging!
