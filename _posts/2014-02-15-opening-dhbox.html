This is it! The inaugural post of the DH Box blog (the DH stands for Digital Humanities). Here we intend to make the process of planning, creating, and publicizing the DH Box transparent for our readers. Hopefully this provides some inspiration, and even a blueprint, for future collaborative DH projects.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves! First, some questions and answers:
<h3>What is DH Box?</h3>
Not much, so far. But we intend it to be a portable, customized environment for Digital Humanities learners that can rely on incredibly inexpensive technology. All you really need is a computer that runs Linux (and a monitor and keyboard, of course!) -- but the platform that excites us most is the <a href="#" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>, a tiny computer that sells for <em>just $35</em>. Imagine a collection of DH tools, pre-installed and configured, and a set of texts for users to interrogate -- all on a portable and inexpensive device.
<h3>What inspired the idea of DH Box?</h3>
Several ongoing humanities projects have begun to take advantage of the continuing miniaturization of computing technology. One in particular excited my imagination: <a>Library Box</a>, which repurposes a wireless router into a “portable digital file distribution tool...that enables delivery of educational, healthcare, and other vital information to individuals off the grid.” The possibilities for 'embedded', specialized miniature computers are massive.
<h3>What is needed to run DH Box?</h3>
Our first major goal is to get DH Box running on the Raspberry Pi. Once that's done, DH Box will also be runnable on nearly any Linux computer!
<h3>Who do you think will use DH Box?</h3>
Anyone and everyone who is interested in <em>learning Digital Humanities inquiry techniques</em>, but especially those who may <em>not have any prior programming experience</em>. We hope that <em>instructors</em> will use our tools to set up almost <em>instant DH labs</em>, and that <em>students</em> will use DH Box to get an edge in their <em>research</em>.

We see DH Box as an example of what is likely to be a robust and interesting future field, 'humanities hardware'.
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<a href="#" target="_blank">We are an interdisciplinary team</a> of learners and do-ers, librarians and developers and digital humanists and more -- with an interest in making DH work more accessible. Find us:
