  <h2 class="dhbox">What is it?</h2>

  <p>DH Box is a <a href="https://github.com/DH-Box/dhbox/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> computer in the cloud. It's simply accessed from any computer as long as you've got an internet connection (and some contextual knowledge). </p>
  
  <br>

  <p>Ready-to-go configurations of <a href="https://github.com/DH-Box/dhbox/wiki/Omeka" target="_blank">Omeka</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DH-Box/dhbox/wiki/NLTK" target="_blank">NLTK</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DH-Box/dhbox/wiki/IPython" target="_blank">IPython</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DH-Box/dhbox/wiki/R-Studio" target="_blank">R Studio</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/DH-Box/dhbox/wiki/Mallet" target="_blank">Mallet</a> live in DH Box. Through this praxis friendly environment, professors and students have instant classroom access to a cadre of gold-standard DH tools. Professors will be able to launch a DH computer lab in just a few minutes and guarantee their students an ideal environment for hands-on learning.</p>
  
  <br>

  <h2 class="dhbox">Why use it?</h2>
  
  <p>DH Box provides a solution to a pervasive problem across academic institutions. With DH Box, faculty have the freedom to integrate DH tools into their curriculum without relying on their IT departments for server administration. DH Box also mitigates the time consuming labor involved with software installations, firewalls, and operating system configurations.</p>
  
  <br>

  <h2 class="dhbox">Who is it ideal for?</h2>
  
  <p>DH Box is designed for college faculty who have familiarity with DH tools like Omeka, NLTK, R Studio, and Mallet. Do you know what the command line is? Do you know what a server does? If you answered yes, <a href="http://dhbox.org/get-started/" target="_blank">let's get started</a>.</p>

  <p>If you're unfamiliar with any of the above, we recommend you engage with some other resources before planning a DH Box launch. Here are several resources to explore:</p>
