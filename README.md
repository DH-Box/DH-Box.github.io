Simple-Jekyll-Bootstrap-Theme
=============================

A simple [Jekyll] (http://jekyllrb.com/) [Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com) theme customized by GitHub user hkellaway based on the One-Page-Wonder Theme by [Start Bootstrap] (http://startbootstrap/).

#How to Cutomize without Coding

- open up the *_config.yml* and change all of the settings under the sections marked MODIFY these settings
- save *_config.yml* and close
- open up the *_data/socialmedia.yml* file -- here, you can like any social media service (make sure to name all required attributes (*name*, *is_displaye*d, etc); if a FontAwesome icon exists for the service (and is listed with FontAweome with the same name you've provided), the icon will be used in the theme -- no extra work!
- open up the *_data/sections.yml* file -- enter as many sections as you like (with all the required attributes). As many sections as you define will be displayed in the theme with corresponding links in the navigation -- no extra work!


You can see an example of a personalized version of this theme [on my site] (http://hkellaway.github.io/).
