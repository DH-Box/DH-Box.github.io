  #description:  Steve is a Reference Librarian working at Hunter College. He is getting his second master’s degree in Liberal Studies, with a focus on Digital Humanities. Stephen likes thinking about emerging technologies and their use in libraries and the classroom.
  display_why: false
  why: Steve proposed DH Box as an assignment in Matt Gold’s DH Praxis class at the CUNY Graduate Center. It has everything he loves in a project- increasing access to technological resources, and enabling computational analysis in the humanities– all in an open source package!

  #description: Cailean is a Librarian at New York City College of Technology and is currently pursuing her second master’s degree in Digital Humanities at the Graduate Center, CUNY. Cailean is excited that this project has given her the opportunity to break into coding. She’s also particularly fascinated by Digital Humanities’ unique approach to humanities education- praxis based learning.
  display_why: false
  why: Cailean is looking forward to contributing to the open source movement as a member of the DH Box project. She is developing a more sophisticated knowledge of the interplay between programming and cloud computing. Cailean expects this learning process to catalyze her curiosity and spawn further inquiry into how computational platforms and open source software can mobilize education and promote information access.
