He is getting his second master’s degree in Liberal Studies, with a focus on Digital Humanities. Stephen likes thinking about emerging technologies and their use in libraries and the classroom. <br><br> Stephen proposed DH Box as an assignment in Matt Gold’s DH Praxis class at the CUNY Graduate Center. It has everything he loves in a project- increasing access to technological resources, and enabling computational analysis in the humanities– all in an open source package!
