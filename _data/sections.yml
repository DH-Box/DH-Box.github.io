  description: DH Box is a Linux computer in the cloud. It contains popular Digital Humanities inquiry software- pre-installed and configured so users can move straight to exploring without sacrificing time and energy on software installations. <br><br>  DH Box makes it simple for scholars (and students-as-scholars) to use powerful computational tools immediately, even if they lack deep computational literacy or full service IT support. Since DH Box is a virtual web server image that lives in the cloud, it can be accessed very easily. If you are a teacher, scholar, or student interested in taking a 'DH' approach to things, DH Box is the perfect place to start.

  description: DH Box is accessible directly from your web browser- all you need is an internet connection. <br><br> <b>Teachers</b> can instantly deploy a computer lab in the cloud, eliminating the need to spend hours fiddling with a roomful of computers. Use the computational tools in DH Box to work collaboratively with students on asking questions, finding answers, and reviewing work in real-time. <br><br> <b>Students</b> can begin using DH tools to develop concrete, widely applicable computational skills without having to purchase new equipment or software. At the same time, they can produce meaningful and easily transmitted works of scholarship. <br><br> We're developing DH Box right now. Stay tuned for announcements on the Alpha version!
